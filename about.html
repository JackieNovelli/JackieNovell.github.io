					<h4><b><u>Non-Profit Work</u></b></h4>
					<p><a href="https://www.scottyshouse.org/">Scotty's House</a> is a non-profit Child Advocacy Center 
					(CAC) serving seven counties in the 
					Brazos Valley: Brazos, Burleson, Grimes, Leon, Madison, Robertson, and Washington. The Scotty's 
					House team collaborates with Child Protective Services (CPS) and law enforcement officials on 
					every case, and our compassionate and collaborative approach is key to providing victims of 
					child abuse and/or neglect with safety, healing, and justice.</p>
					
					<h4><b><u>Concessions</u></b></h4>
					<p>In order to raise money for Scotty's House, AggieCon, and all our other events, we participate 
					in TAMU's game days. We do concessions durinf football games, baseball, and sometimes softball games.
					We recieve part of the money we produce in the food stand and it it put toward our activities.
					We encourage all our members to go to at least three games.</p>
					
					<h4><b><u>Profit-Share (D-Raid)</u></b></h4>
					<p>After our meetings, we have profit shares to make a little extra cash. These will be at local 
					resturants around College Station. During these dinner times, we tell stories of Cepheid that have 
					been passed down from year to year. Many times, members recieve nicknames (D-Names) after doing 
					stupid or awesome things.</p>
