					<h2><u>Events</u></h2>
					<p>Cepheid Variable hosts many small and large events for student and non-students. 
					We host two main non-profit events per year and give all the proceeds to Scotty's House,
					our donation organization. If you would like to know more, please visit our About Page! 
					Otherwise here is some of our main events explained. To get involved, please email us 
					for more information.</p>

					<h4><b><u>Fall MSC Open House</u></b></h4>
					<p>The Fall and Spring MSC Open House is one of our main tabling events to get students and 
					alumni involved in the organization. The following Tuesday is usually our Fish, or Freshman 
					meeting. At that time, we explain who we are, what we do, and what kind of things we do for 
					our members.</p>
					
					<h4><b><u>Convention Trips</u></b></h4>
					<p>During each semester and sometimes into the summer, we take our members to experience 
					popular convention across Texas. This way our fellow nerds can learn more about conventions, 
					hotel booking, and public cosplay. Many of our members want to get involved in convention 
					planning, so this and our annual con, AggieCon, helps our members have an interactive 
					experience.</p>
					
					<h4><b><u>Board Game Days</u></b></h4>
					<p>Board game days are days that our members can play any table top game they can imagine. 
					Cepheid has over 300+ board games and plenty of DM's for Dungeons & Dragon campaigns.</p>
					
					<h4><b><u>Other Events</u></b></h4>
					<p>In order to give the most to its members, Cepheid tries to go to as many places and events 
					as possible. We go to the State Fair of Texas, Conventions, downtown Houston, restarants, and 
					so many more. Check our our social media to see what we are up to!</p>
