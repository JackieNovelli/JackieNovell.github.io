					<h4><b><u>AggieCon</u></b></h4>
					<p>AggieCon is the longest running convention in the world and Cepheid Variable hosts it! 
					AggieCon is one of our non-profit evens that helps to raise thousands of dollars for children 
					in need. It is a bit of a "congloma-con," because we cater to all types of fandoms, including 
					Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Gamin, Horror, Anime, TableTop Gaming and many more! Every one is welcome to 
					our convention. We are proud to say we are a family friendly event!</p>
					<p>Held annually since 1969 by Cepheid Variable at Texas A&M University's Memorial Student 
					Center, it has grown to become one of the larger conventions in Texas. AggieCon was the first 
					science fiction convention ever sponsored by a college or a college affiliate student 
					organization.</p>

					<h4><b><u>News!</u></b></h4>
					<p>AggieCon 51 is coming soon! But we need your help to make it as good as 2019. AggieCon is a 100% 
					student-led con which means we rasie all the money ourselves. If you are a student at TAMU (Texas A&M 
					University), check out our parent club, Cepheid Variable. We do profit shares and game concessions 
					in order to raise the money. If you would like to donate to our student con, feel free to mesage us 
					at aggiecondirector@gmail.com to see how you can help. We also have t-shirts and other merch coming 
					soon to purchase from many of our last conventions. These are collectible and look super amazing!</p>
